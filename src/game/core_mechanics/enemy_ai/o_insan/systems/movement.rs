// üèÉ MOVEMENT SYSTEM - AI Physical Action Execution
// ============================================================================
//
// This system is responsible for translating behavior decisions into actual
// movement and physical actions in the game world.
//
// üìã RESPONSIBILITIES:
// - Execute movement based on current behavior
// - Handle different movement patterns (wandering, chasing, escaping, begging)
// - Manage movement speed and direction calculations
// - Handle AI orientation and looking directions

/// üéØ MOVEMENT EXECUTION SYSTEM
/// 
/// This actually moves the AI based on its current behavior decisions.
/// It's the physical execution layer that translates decisions into actions.
///
/// üìã DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
/// - Separate decision-making from execution (behavior system decides, this executes)
/// - Each behavior has distinct movement patterns
/// - Movement is frame-rate independent using delta time
/// - Different behaviors have different movement speeds for game feel
