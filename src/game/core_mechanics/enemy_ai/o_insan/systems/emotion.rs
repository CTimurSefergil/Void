// This system is responsible for calculating and updating the AI's emotional state

// ðŸ“‹ RESPONSIBILITIES:
// - Calculate emotional state based on health percentage
// - Update emotional state when conditions change
// - Provide emotional state transitions and logging

/// ðŸŽ¯ EMOTION CALCULATION SYSTEM
/// 
/// This is the HEART of the AI - it decides how the AI feels based on health
/// and other contextual factors.
///
/// ðŸ“‹ DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
/// - Emotions are INTERNAL feelings, not behaviors
/// - Emotions drive behavior decisions, but don't directly control actions
/// - Emotional transitions are logged for debugging and immersion
/// - System is stateless and purely reactive to current conditions
